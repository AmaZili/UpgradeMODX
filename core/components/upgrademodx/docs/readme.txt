<p>Once the package is installed, you should see the widget in the default dashboard. When an upgrade is available, you will see an Upgrade MODX button in the widget. To upgrade your site, just click on it (but back up the site first). For details on configuring UpgradeMODX, see the documentation link above.</p>

<p>This package was inspired by the work of a number of people and I have borrowed some of their code. I still haven't been able to get the names of all of them (there are no authors listed in the code), but Susan Sottwell, dmi3yy, inreti, Zaigham Rana, frischnetz, and AgelxNash, all contributed and I'd like to thank them for laying the groundwork.</p>
