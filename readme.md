Package created with MyComponent

Important! This package is a beta version. It has not been tested on a wide variety of platforms and is missing important sanity checks and error handling. It is definitely not recommended for use on production sites at this time. 

Please leave feedback on the issues page if you find any problems with the package.

This Package (UpgradeMODX) is designed to upgrade MODX from the dashboard of the MODX Manager.

The package installs a dashboard widget that reports whether an upgrade is available. When an upgrade is available, an Upgrade MODX button will appear that will launch the install form. The form gives you the option to select a version of MODX to upgrade to. Once you've selected a version, UpgradeMODX will download the files, put them in the proper locations, and launch setup (be patient, this part takes some time).
 
 See the properties tab of the UpgradeMODXWidget snippet for the options and their descriptions and be sure to read the documentation at the link above.
 
 It's always a good idea to back up your site before clicking on the Install button. If downloading the files succeeds and setup fails, your site may be broken.
 
This package was inspired by the work of a number of people and I have borrowed some of their code. I still haven't been able to get the names of all of them (there are no authors listed in the code), but Susan Sottwell, dmi3yy, inreti, Zaigham Rana, frischnetz, and AgelxNash, all contributed and I'd like to thank them for laying the groundwork.
